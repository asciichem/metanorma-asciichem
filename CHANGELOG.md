## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- `[chem]` block: AsciiChem source parses to the semantic model and
  renders as a MathML stem (`<formula><stem type="MathML">` in
  Metanorma semantic XML). Block ids and titles carry over; invalid
  sources log an error and keep the block as sourcecode.
- `chem:[]` inline macro (target and attribute forms) for inline
  chemistry.
- Substance citations: `@cite`-annotated molecules in `[chem]` blocks
  resolve through `AsciiChem::Citation` to dataset-type Relaton
  bibitems, one per (source, substance), deduplicated, anchored by
  InChIKey, appended as a `[bibliography]` section.
- `:asciichem-cache-dir:` document attribute for offline,
  reproducible citation resolution.
